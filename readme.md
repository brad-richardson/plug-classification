Plug Classification

To setup, follow the first few pages of this guide until you reach "retrieving the images":
https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/index.html

You can use the scripts in model/ from inside the TF docker image to train and optimize the model.

The apps expect these files in model/ during compilation:
model/mmapped_graph.pb
model/retrained_labels.txt
