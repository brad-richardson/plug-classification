  "body": "### Abstract\r\nThe objective of this project is to explore the use of a convolutional neural network to identify plugs in real- time using a mobile app. In this project, we hope to be able to facilitate the identification of plugs using an simple mobile app that anyone can use.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nTechnology advances at a rapid pace and lots of new hardware is created to facilitate those advances. One of the issues with these hardware changes is that we have so many different ports and plugs that it is hard to remember what they all do or even distinguish them. The average person probably doesnâ€™t know what all the ports on a computer are used for.\r\n\r\n### Methods\r\nWith recent advances in neural networks and machine learning, it has become much more realistic to classify images without needing massive amounts of processing power. Even mobile devices are now able to perform the computations necessary for convolutional neural networks. This project uses the Inception model which was developed using the TensorFlow machine intelligence software library. The Inception model was chosen for this project because of its ease of use and ability to quickly retrain to a new set of images.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n|                               | Plug only | Port only | Combined |\r\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\r\n| Port categories only          | 19%       | 87%       | 50%      |\r\n| Plug/port categories combined | 89%       | 78%       | 83%      |\r\n| Plug/port categories separate | 93%       | 94%       | 94%      |\r\n\r\nThe results showed a much higher accuracy when plug and port categories were separated and used in training the model.\r\nAnecdotally, the app was able to give accurate guesses for the majority of attempts. The correct plug was almost always in the top 5 results.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nOverall, results were very positive. With an accuracy of over 90% in controlled experiments, it would be feasible to create an app for use in the general public. By adding detailed information about each of the plugs, it will hopefully become a useful tool. The spread of this technology will become useful in many other fields as well.\r\n",
